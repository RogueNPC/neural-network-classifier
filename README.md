# Neural Network Classifier

This Int 1.2 Project uses MedMNIST datasets to create a basic neural network classifier that identifies medical diagnoses and treatable diseases by image-based deep learning

## Getting Started

Simply go to the Jupyter notebook "Int 1.2 OCTMNIST_classification.ipynb", connect to the hosted runtime, and run the code from top to bottom.

Comments and text boxes explain what is going on every step of the way.

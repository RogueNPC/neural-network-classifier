# Neural Network Classifier

This Int 1.2 Project uses an MedMNIST dataset to create a basic neural network classifier that identifies a variety of eye conditions and eye diseases such as macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy (the top three diseases known to cause blindness) using image-based deep learning.  The images in this dataset are gathered using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) which allow doctors to see a cross section of the retina.

## Getting Started

Simply go to the Jupyter notebook "Int 1.2 OCTMNIST_classification.ipynb", connect to the hosted runtime, and run the code from top to bottom.

Comments and text boxes explain what is going on every step of the way.
